# Go-Port-Proxy-Server
This Go script sets up an HTTP server on port `2701` that proxies requests to any local port (`0` to `65535`). Access local services using `http://127.0.0.1:2701/{port}`. It's useful for forwarding HTTP requests to various services on your machine and supports connecting to services like SSH through port forwarding.
